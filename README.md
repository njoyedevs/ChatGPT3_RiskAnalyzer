# ChatGPT3 Market Risk Analyzer

In this project, Python was utilized to develop a full-stack web application with ChatGPT3 for fine-tuning the AI model with 40 years of economic data. The application is designed to analyze the normal distribution of various datasets obtained from the FRED API.

## About

ChatGPT3 Market Risk Analyzer is a full-stack application developed using Python, Flask, OpenAI, FredAP, Pandas, NumPy, jsonlines, CSV, Bcrypt, Plotly, PyMySQL, and RegEx. The application fine-tunes ChatGPT3 on 40 years of economic data using nine datasets found on the FRED API. A normal distribution algorithm was engineered to categorize each data point into eight percentile ranges. The ChatGPT3 Curie model was fine-tuned using both original economic data and normal distribution categorizations, achieving a high accuracy rate in predicting the monthly normal distribution category for novel data points across all nine datasets.
