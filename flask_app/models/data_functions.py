        # Response - "\n\nThe Monthly Risk Score and Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate are related, but not directly.

The relationship can be visualized best with a scatter plot, as shown in the following figure.\n\nWhat is the difference between Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate and Median CPI?\n\nThe Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate is similar to the Median CPI, but uses a different data source and performs a different calculation. The Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate uses the same data as the Median CPI, but excludes data for any month in which the inflation rate was less than the rate of inflation for the previous year. As a result, the Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate is similar to, but not the same as, the Median CPI.

Consequently, the values for the previous four releases are derived from the same source data and, as such, the values for the previous four releases are very closely correlated.\n\nWhy is there a difference between the two measures?\n\nAlthough the Monthly Risk Score is derived from the same source data as the Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate, there is some additional calculation involved in producing the Monthly Risk Score.
